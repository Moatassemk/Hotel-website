# Booking Website Readme

This README provides an explanation of the HTML code for a booking website. The website is designed to allow users to book rooms in a hotel. Below is a detailed breakdown of the code:

## 1. Getting Started

To set up and use this HTML file for your booking website, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the Code**: Copy the HTML code provided in this file.
2. **Create an HTML File**: Create a new HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) and paste the copied code into it.
3. **Save the File**: Save the HTML file.
4. **View the Website**: Open the HTML file in a web browser to view and interact with the booking website.

## 2. File Structure

The HTML file is structured as follows:

- **Document Type Declaration (`<!DOCTYPE>`)**: Specifies that this is an HTML5 document.
- **HTML Element (`<html>`)**: The root element of the HTML document.
- **Head Section (`<head>`)**: Contains metadata and external resources, such as stylesheets and fonts.
- **Body Section (`<body>`)**: The main content of the webpage is placed here.

## 3. Styling

The webpage is designed with a simple and visually appealing style. The key styling features include:

- **Header**: The header has a dark background with white text and is centered at the top of the page.
- **Main Content Area**: The main content is enclosed in a white box with rounded corners and a subtle shadow, creating a card-like appearance.
- **Form Styling**: Form elements like labels, input fields, and buttons are styled for user-friendliness.
- **Custom CSS**: The webpage uses custom CSS for styling, and additional styles can be applied as needed.

## 4. Functionality

The webpage includes a booking form with the following functionality:

- **Name, Email, Date, and Time**: Users can enter their name, email, date, and time for their booking.
- **Room Selection**: A dropdown list allows users to select a room with different prices.
- **Number of Nights**: Users can specify the number of nights they want to book.
- **Total Price Calculation**: The total price is automatically calculated based on the selected room and the number of nights.

JavaScript is used to enhance the functionality of the form, providing the following features:

- **Real-Time Price Updates**: The total price is updated in real-time as users input the number of nights.
- **Form Validation**: Validation ensures that users select a valid room, specify the number of nights, and choose a future date and time.
- **Summary of Bookings**: A summary of all room bookings, including the total price, is displayed to users.

## 5. Footer and Social Media Links

The webpage includes a footer with social media links. The footer is designed with a dark background and white text. The social media links are represented by icons and include links to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. You can customize these links by modifying the `href` attributes in the HTML code. Users can click on these links to visit your social media profiles.

This code can be customized and integrated into a larger website or web application to provide booking functionality for hotels or similar services. It offers a clean and functional user interface for booking rooms and connecting with users through social media.
